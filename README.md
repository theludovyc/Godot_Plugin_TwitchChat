# Godot_Plugin_TwitchChat
Based on https://github.com/MennoMax/gift add a docked chat in Godot Editor

**Install**<br/>
Copy "TwitchChat" folder in your "res://addons/"(maybe you need to create it) folder.
Add a "auth.txt" file in your "res://" folder.<br/>
In it :<br/>
YourName<br/>
TwitchToken<br/>
ChannelName<br/>

To obtain twitch token https://twitchtokengenerator.com/

**Why ?**<br/>
Because I have single screen. Before I was need to switch between Godot Editor and Chat, or reduce godot to see chat. Now I can see chat and have Godot Editor in full-screen.
